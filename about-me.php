        <p>
            My name is Jake Ten Eyck, and I am a computer science student at the University of Vermont. I became interested in the topic
            of DCI shows in high school when some of my marching band staff suggested that we try out the activity and see how
            we like it. I then went on to march with the Spartans out of Nashua, New Hampshire in 2018 and 2019, where I became
            infatuated with the activity. Having watched two years of world class finals in person, I realize now how strongly others
            feel about the activity. Because of this, I decided to make this website so others in the activity would be able to share
            their love of the marching arts with each other.
